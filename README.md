# To God be the glory

This project was to scrap the twi(Akan) version of the Seventh-day Adventist hymnal from [link](https://www.hymnalaccompanist.com/twi/twinumber.html).

## Objective
The church wanted to present the twi version of the hymnal during church service and I decided to scrap the text that I will use later to build a presentation application for the church.
